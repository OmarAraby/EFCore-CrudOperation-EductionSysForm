**A Dynamic Educational Management System Built with EF Core and Windows Forms**

Welcome to **EducationSysForm**, a robust desktop application designed to streamline the management of educational data with an intuitive and interactive user interface. Built using **Entity Framework Core** and **Windows Forms**, this project offers full CRUD operations for entities such as Students, Courses, Departments, and Course Sessions, all while adhering to modern software development practices.

This project was developed as part of my journey to create efficient and user-friendly applications, with a focus on integrating branding elements from the **Information Technology Institute (ITI)**

## üåü Features

- **Dynamic Form Generation**: Automatically generates input forms for any entity using reflection, minimizing repetitive code.
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete records seamlessly for Students, Courses, Departments, Instructors, Course Sessions, and more.
- **Interactive UI**: Custom-designed interface with:
    - Tabbed navigation for easy access to different entities.
    - Hover effects, tab animations, and a clean layout for a polished user experience.
- **Entity Framework Core Integration**: Efficient database operations with a code-first approach, supporting complex relationships like composite keys (e.g., `CourseStudent`).
- **Data Validation**: Ensures required fields are filled and validates specific rules (e.g., Course Session dates must be today or in the future).
- **Custom Styling**: Tailored DataGridView and controls with ITI‚Äôs branding for a professional look.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- **.NET Framework** (version 9 or higher)
- **SQL Server** (or any database compatible with EF Core)
- **Visual Studio** (2022 or later recommended)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OmarAraby/EFCore-CrudOperation-EductionSysForm.git
    cd EFCore-CrudOperation-EductionSysForm
    ```
    
2. **Set Up the Database**:
    
    - Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` or your configuration file to point to your SQL Server instance.
    - Run the following commands in the Package Manager Console to apply migrations:
        
        ```bash
        Update-Database
        ```
        
3. **Build and Run**:
    
    - Open the solution (`EducationSysProject.sln`) in Visual Studio.
    - Build the project (Ctrl+Shift+B).
    - Run the application (F5).

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Launch the Application**:
    
    - Upon running, you‚Äôll see the main interface with the ITI logo at the top and a tabbed layout for different entities (Students, Courses, etc.).
2. **Navigate Tabs**:
    
    - Click on a tab (e.g., "Courses") to view its records in the DataGridView.
    - The form on the left dynamically updates to show fields for the selected entity.
3. **Perform CRUD Operations**:
    
    - **Create**: Fill the form and click "Save" to add a new record.
    - **Read**: Select a record from the DataGridView to populate the form with its data.
    - **Update**: Edit the form fields and click "Save" to update the record.
    - **Delete**: Select a record and click "Delete" to remove it (disabled by default until a record is selected).
4. **Special Handling for CourseStudent**:
    
    - Due to the composite key (`CourseID`, `StudentID`), updating a `CourseStudent` record will delete the old record and create a new one with the updated values.
